# Exploratory Data Analysis project1

This is the repository for the first Assignment for Exploratory Data Analysis.
There are a totla of 8 files. R Scripts plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R which creates the png files plot1, plot2, plot3, and plot4.

###Instructions:
1) Download the Data set from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip to home directory

2) Run Each of 4 R scripts to create the png files for respective plots.


###Variables:
This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

**Dataset**: Electric power consumption https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

**Description**: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

**Date**: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

**Time**: time in format hh:mm:ss

**Global_active_power**: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

**Global_reactive_power**: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

**Voltage**: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

**Global_intensity**: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

**Sub_metering_1**: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

**Sub_metering_2**: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

**Sub_metering_3**: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
